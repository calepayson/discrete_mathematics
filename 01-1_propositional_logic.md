# Propositional logic

## Propositions

A **proposition** is a declerative sentence that is either true or false, but not both.
- My name is Cale

**Propositional variables** represent propositions. These are conventionally p, q, r, s, ... .
- p = My name is Cale

**Logical operators** (not, and, or, etc.) allow us to combine propositions into **compound propositions**.

The **conjuction** of two propositions is 'and'.
- p and q

The **disjunction** of two propositions is 'or'.
- p or q

The **Exclusive** fo two propositions is 'xor'.
- p xor q

## Conditional Statements

The **conditional statement** of two propositions is '->'. 
- p -> q == if p then q

The **converse** of a conditional is the reverse
- q -> p

The **contrapositive** of a conditional is the negation of each statement in the converse
- !q -> !p

The **inverse** of a conditional is the negation of each statement
- !p -> !q

If two compound propositions have the same truth values they are **equivalent**.

The **Biconditional statement** of two propositions is '<->'
- p <-> q == if and only if p then q
